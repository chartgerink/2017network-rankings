# Question based metrics

## Introduction

1. Scholarly research has been said to face a reproducibility crisis, but the underlying cause of this is the incentive system that we have created for ourselves. 

### Current metrics

1. backward looking
2. invalid
    * journal impact factor
    * citations
    * h-index
3. not question based
    * use bad proxy because nothing else is available ("we have to do something")

## Granular communication

### Empirical cycle

1. Change empirical cycle into empirical network.
2. Directional adjacency matrix in a [Directional Acyclic Graph (DAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)
3. Ordered by time (ensures chronology)
4. Subsetting of networks EASY after ordering for time (just take i:j,i:j)
5. [Topological sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting)
6. Y direct descendant of X

### Network structure


<!-- Most important right now -->

- [ ] Create illustrations for 2^(1:10) w topological sort
- [ ] Explain network composition for a select few

## Renewing metrics

### Backward looking
### Forward looking

## Use cases

### Funders

### Individual researchers

### Evaluation committees

### Universities

### Award committees

* critical path computation, allows for recognition of all involved players.

## Discussion



# Infrastructure notes

These popped-up during the project, but are out of scope and will be used for a more infrastructure based project:

* Sparse matrices will be necessary to make the network adjacency matrix efficient
* Can think about [incidence matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_matrix) as relational indicators
