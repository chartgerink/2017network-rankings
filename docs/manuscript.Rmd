# Question based metrics

## Introduction

Scholarly research has been said to face a reproducibility crisis, but the underlying cause of this is the incentive system. 

### Current metrics

1. backward looking
2. invalid
    * journal impact factor
    * citations
    * h-index
3. not question based
    * use bad proxy because nothing else is available ("we have to do something")

## Granular communication

```{r out.width="100%", out.height="100%"}
knitr::include_app('test-figure.html')
```
